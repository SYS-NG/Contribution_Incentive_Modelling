# Monetary-Reputation Incentive Mechanisms in Decentralized Contribution Systems

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive agent-based computational model to investigate the interplay between monetary and reputation-based incentive mechanisms in decentralized contribution environments. The simulation framework enables rigorous examination of how varied incentive structures influence contribution quality, participation dynamics, and overall system utility across heterogeneous contributor populations.

The research addresses several key theoretical and practical questions:
1. What is the nature of the interaction between monetary and reputation-based incentives in eliciting high-quality contributions?
2. How can incentive mechanisms be optimally calibrated to maximize platform utility while maintaining contributor engagement?
3. In what manner do heterogeneous agent types—differentiated by intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation—respond to various incentive structures?
4. What are the dynamics of system stability and evolutionary characteristics across different incentive configurations?
5. Under what conditions do these socio-technical systems converge to Nash equilibria?

## Theoretical Framework

The model is formulated as a Bayesian repeated game with imperfect monitoring, integrating elements from game theory, behavioral economics, and motivation science:

- **Bayesian Game Structure**: A formal game-theoretic framework with incomplete information, where heterogeneous contributors with private type information interact with a central platform mechanism
- **Experience-Weighted Attraction Learning**: An advanced cognitive learning architecture that synthesizes reinforcement learning and belief-based approaches, with parametric control over exploration-exploitation trade-offs
- **Expected Utility Maximization**: Agents employ decision rules based on expected utility calculations with type-dependent parameter specifications
- **Motivation Crowding Theory**: Theoretical foundation addressing how extrinsic incentives can either diminish or amplify intrinsic motivation
- **Reputation Mechanisms**: Formalization of reputation as both a quality signaling device and a non-monetary incentive structure
- **Nash Equilibrium Analysis**: Systematic investigation of convergence properties toward ε-Nash equilibria, representing stable states where no agent has incentive to unilaterally deviate from their strategy

## Implementation Architecture

The computational model implements a multi-agent system with the following components:

### Core Architectural Elements
- **Agent Architecture**: Implementation of `ContributorAgent` and `PlatformAgent` classes in `agents.py` with sophisticated decision processes grounded in bounded rationality
- **Model Framework**: Development of the `IncentiveModel` class utilizing the Mesa framework in `model.py` with integrated ε-Nash equilibrium detection mechanisms
- **Incentive Mechanism Design**: Implementation of multiple reward distribution algorithms in `reward_distributor.py`:
  - Weighted distribution (allocating disproportionately higher rewards to higher quality contributions)
  - Linear distribution (rewards allocated in strict proportion to contribution quality)
  - Threshold distribution (rewards allocated exclusively to contributions exceeding a predefined quality threshold)
  - Reputation-weighted distribution (incorporating contributor reputation history into reward calculations)
- **Simulation Framework**: Comprehensive simulation architecture in `simulation.py` featuring parameter space exploration, Nash equilibrium analysis, and extensive data visualization capabilities

### Agent Characteristics and Decision Processes
- **Contributor Typology**: The model incorporates heterogeneous agent populations with distinct sensitivity profiles toward incentive types:
  - Extrinsically motivated agents (primarily responsive to monetary incentives)
  - Intrinsically motivated agents (primarily responsive to reputation/internal satisfaction)
- **Skill Differentiation**: Heterogeneous skill distribution (high/low) affecting probabilistic contribution quality outcomes
- **Decision Mechanisms**: Sophisticated utility functions for action selection incorporating:
  - Expected monetary rewards (updated through exponential recency-weighted averaging)
  - Expected reputation gains
  - Intrinsic satisfaction coefficients
  - Effort cost functions
- **Learning Dynamics**: Experience-Weighted Attraction (EWA) learning model parameterized by:
  - Experience decay factor (phi parameter)
  - Foregone payoff weighting (delta parameter)
  - Choice probability sharpness (lambda parameter)

### Data Collection and Analytical Methods
- **System Metrics**: Systematic collection of temporal metrics including:
  - Mean contribution quality
  - Participation rates (aggregate and disaggregated by agent type)
  - Distribution of contribution quality across the quality spectrum
  - Platform utility, benefit function, and cost structure
  - Reputation distribution inequality (Gini coefficient)
  - Nash equilibrium proximity measures
- **Stability Analysis**: Quantitative assessment of metric variation and temporal dynamics
- **Equilibrium Properties**: Detection and characterization of ε-Nash equilibria and convergence patterns

### Visualization and Analysis Suite
The implementation includes extensive visualization capabilities for scientific analysis:
- **Temporal Analysis**: Participation dynamics, quality evolution, and platform utility trajectories
- **Parameter Response Functions**: Effects of effort costs on key outcome metrics across reward distribution strategies
- **Comparative Strategy Assessment**: Quantitative effectiveness comparison across different incentive mechanisms
- **Quality Distribution Analysis**: Multidimensional visualization of contribution quality stratification
- **Economic Analysis**: Platform benefit-cost analysis and utility optimization
- **Agent Behavioral Analysis**: Response patterns by contributor typology
- **Equilibrium Analysis**: Convergence trajectories, stability properties, and time-to-equilibrium metrics
- **Reward Evolution**: Temporal patterns in reward allocation mechanisms

## Experimental Results

Systematic computational experiments have been conducted across multiple parameter configurations and incentive strategies:

1. **Incentive Mechanism Comparison**: Rigorous analysis of weighted, linear, threshold-based, and reputation-weighted reward distribution algorithms
2. **Effort Cost Sensitivity**: Parametric analysis of effort cost variations on system dynamics and equilibrium properties
3. **Agent Type Response Patterns**: Examination of behavioral differences across heterogeneous agent populations under varying incentive structures
4. **Platform Economic Analysis**: Assessment of benefit-cost trade-offs and overall platform utility maximization
5. **Equilibrium Characterization**: Analysis of conditions facilitating stability and convergence to Nash equilibrium states
6. **Reputation Dynamics**: Investigation of reputation formation processes and their impact on incentive effectiveness

Experimental results and data visualizations are archived in the `results` directory as structured CSV files and visualization artifacts.

## Usage Protocol

The model can be instantiated and executed programmatically:

```python
# Import the simulation framework
from simulation import SimulationRunner

# Initialize the simulation environment with specified output directory
runner = SimulationRunner(results_dir="results")

# Execute a comprehensive experiment with specified parameters
runner.run_experiment(output_prefix="experiment", epsilon=0.2, use_ewa=True)
```

    num_steps=100,
    num_trials=3,
    num_contributors=500,
    effort_cost_std=0.5,
    reward_strategy="weighted",
    extrinsic_ratio=0.5,
    intrinsic_ratio=0.5,
    low_skill_ratio=0.5,
    phi=0.9,              # Experience decay parameter
    delta=0.1,            # Foregone payoff weighting
    lambda_param=5.0,     # Choice probability sharpness
    reward_learning_rate=0.2,  # Reward estimate learning rate
    epsilon=0.2,          # Nash equilibrium threshold
    use_ewa=True          # EWA learning activation
